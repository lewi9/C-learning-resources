Task 1
Create a program that's follow specification:
- Takes a file name as argument, there is only one position argument, if more or less - print message to stderr and exit
- Open the file. File has N+1 integers. The first one is number N. Intergers are writen on 4 bytes each. You should use read()
e.g after "translate"
3
1234
42356
19
- You should use calloc to allocate memory for N numbers
- Program reads numbers and store (except first, which is N number) in allocated array
- Program should print numbers as string, the first digit means width of printed string
e.g
325753 should be printed as 325
if first digit is lower than number of digits, the number should be aligned to left

Result in terminal for './prog ex1.bin'

Result in terminal for './prog'
"There is no file path given"
Result in terminal for './prog ex1.txt ex2.txt' 
"Too much paths were given"

You should use calloc, open, read, printf
You should declare some functions, not all code in main!
HINT: sprintf (convert int to string)

You can find solution in dir task1-solution

Example of functions
// fd - file descriptor, this is result of open function
// int fd = open(path, flags)

int * createArray( int fd, int * N );

void readNumbers( int fd, int * ptr, int size );

void printNumbers( int * ptr, int size );
